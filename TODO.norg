* Neovim
  - [ ] wrap (or fully display) diagnostics
  - [ ] display diagnostics differently on hover(?)
  - [ ] list all diagnostics in quickfix (learn to navigate)
  - [ ] navigate diagnostic messages
  - [x] do I want <C-F> and <C-B> back? If so, need to change TMux leader + :NERDTreeFind cmd
  - [ ] tab auto-complete for :e is painful when you hit the directory you want and want new-tab
  - [ ] need to decide on how I'm going to write and interact with notes (pandoc?) plus appropriate plugins
  - [ ] for grading purposes: sum up the numbers at the unchecked bullets
  - [ ] Get copy-paste to actually work...
  - [ ] I should have a jump-to-definition command where I can type in the name of a function that should be defined in the same file and go there, something extremely lightweight (as alternative to search)
  - [ ] There's a real issue with display_type in Typescript LSP: doesn't walk the daisy-chain to a meaningful type. It /shouldn't/ stop at imports, certainly.
  - [ ] <ESC> should also :noh?
  - [ ] <C-E>, <C-D>, <C-F> -- should all leave the cursor on the same relative row
  - [ ] multi-cursor support for grab all instances of a pattern and making that shift, in a way that's more convenient than crazy s/ patterns
  - [ ] center-cursor command (or center window on cursor?)
  - [ ] for some reason, selecting a file in NERDTree never opens the selected buffer in a pane where a terminal buffer is open, even if my cursor originated from that pane
  - [ ] get indentation to behave the way I want in racket
  - [ ] tabbing to the end of simple snippets, which is not working :(
